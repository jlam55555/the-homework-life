    <h1>As of February 2016,</h1>
    I believe that not all books are equal.
    I believe a book’s cover <em>can</em> be used
    to judge a book, but
    I believe people cannot be judged, and
    I believe first impressions are misleading.
    I believe people are difficult and obscure.
    I believe code is very sophisticated and confusing,
    but only if you don’t like math.
    I believe math is a beautiful framework
    of truths and elegance.
    I believe I am losing my mind.
    I believe minding schoolwork will make me
    into a Holden-like character sometime
    far in the future, when I will be old and unkind.
    I believe that not all men are evil nor mean,
    but they will always lie.
    I believe lies are detrimental to your physical health.
    I believe that health depends on how your
    mindset is set up, but
    I believe some things <em>are</em> impossible.
    I believe infinity does exist.
    I believe death is not silence,
    not a lack of remembrance nor concern.
    I believe life is simply a lucky circumstantial biological possibility.
    I believe in science and evolution.
    I believe bowling is not easier than schoolwork.
    I believe sports are to the body as homework is to the mind.
    I believe homework is not essential
    unless you really want it to be.
    I believe in wanting to work for Google, but
    I believe monopolies do not last for long.
    I believe government is an experiment,
    testing people’s reactions to different
    people and different political candidates.
    I believe if Donald Trump does win this election,
    many people will move to Canada and
    avoid the rude edicts he will have passed.
    I believe moving means a new life,
    a new school, and new connections.
    I believe I have no best friend.
    I believe favorites do not exist,
    but merely slight inclinations towards
    those that you agree with.
    I believe I will not agree with you,
    at some point or another.
    I believe that at some time, we will all
    encounter death.
    I believe immortality is simply an idea
    to play around with and fantasize
    about, but nothing to consider seriously.
    I believe seriousness is something
    that too many youth avoid today.
    I believe that in the world of today,
    technology is the biggest productivity booster.
    I believe productivity means work.
    I believe more effort means more reward.
    I believe in the American Dream.
    I believe dreams are almost tangible,
    realistic goals that people often overestimate.
    I believe people often overestimate me.
    I believe I am a realist.
    I believe realism is when someone
    asks, “Why should I?” before “Why not?”
    I believe optimism is too often
    our worst mistakes, miscalculations, misses.
    I believe errors can be learned from.
    I believe development and globalization
    is the future of the international community, and
    I believe cultural differences will cease
    to be an issue of major importance in the future.
    I believe the future can be changed by just one person.
    I believe in the individual.
    I believe this poem has gotten too long, and
    I believe it has gotten too repetitive,
    even if anaphora was part of the task.
    I believe that tasks should be carried out,
    rules followed, laws obeyed.
    I believe in democracy, but
    I believe a republic
    often leads to mob mentality.
    I believe rule by the majority did kill Socrates,
    and that it has killed many others
    through conflict and chaos.
    I believe chaos and entropy reigns in the end,
    as said by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
    I believe my binder is a chaotic mess.
    I believe organization is important, but
    I believe I am not determined enough.
    I believe determination is increasingly lacking
    when technology is ever more abundant.
    I believe inverse relationships are very beautiful,
    with mathematical limitations
    and infinities
    and curves
    and many revelations along the way.
    I believe my computer battery is about to run dry, and
    I believe that I have left my charger downstairs.
    I believe there is not much more time to write,
    unless I muster up the courage
    to walk down the stairs
    and organize my binder.
    I believe my life will end quietly.
    I believe silence is but the <em>lack</em> of sound,
    much as cold is the lack of heat.
    I believe some things can only be described
    when compared to their opposites.
    I believe Nathaniel is correct when he says
    our beliefs don’t matter, and
    I believe few will ever read this.
    I believe pencils and erasers
    are more influential than the tool I type on now, but
    I believe I am too lazy.
    I believe my demise will be of my own doing.
    I believe that the uses of the Spanish future tense are rather confusing.
    I believe that learning languages
    is quite the mental exercise, but
    I believe that my sister’s statistics about it are incorrect.
    I believe learning a second language is much harder
    than a first, but
    I believe that a third is easier than a second.
    I believe that I am multilingual, fluent or learning in
    English and Spanish and Chinese
    and HTML and CSS and JS (and jQuery) and PHP
    and SQL and JSON and Java and C and C++ and more.
    I believe in technicalities, and
    I believe that code <em>is</em> technically made up of languages, but
    I believe that it is impossible to speak code,
    impossible to make real the virtual world,
    unrealistic to bring back the dead.
    I believe that loss is a natural thing.
    I believe that acceptance is the only remedy to grief.
    I believe that apologies are one level,
    but forgiveness is the next by a large threshold.
    I believe that America is becoming more radical,
    more violent, more crazy, but
    I believe that we still are one people.
    I believe that no terrorist, no anti-democratic ideology
    can shake the mountain of a foundation
    the Constitution rooted us into.
    I believe that no one can move a mountain, but
    I believe in dynamite.
    I believe my battery is lasting longer than I thought it would, but
    I believe that is probably because I got my charger.
    I believe the first step is usually the hardest,
    even in a journey of a thousand miles; but
    I believe every step is the most painful
    when it comes to cross country.
    I believe that boys are far more athletic, but
    I believe that girls are getting the edge on academics.
    I believe that awards and records
    are simply numbers waiting to be broken.
    I believe that forever and never
    come quicker than you might imagine.
    I believe that my conscience is starting to slip
    as school crams more and more into
    this brain of mine.
    I believe springtime is just
    a defined quarter of the calendar.
    I believe February is the time
    for raging snowstorms, falling branches,
    and a day of love.
    I believe Valentine’s Day is too
    artificial, insincere, unreal.
    I believe prom is an enterprise too expensive,
    breaking too many piggy banks,
    hearts, and puppy-love dreams.
    I believe my beliefs are no great matter
    when others oppose me in a
    majority-dominated society.
    I believe I would hate being a political leader.
    I believe my father would be,
    if he somehow got around to it,
    a terrible leader.
    I believe street-smarts are more important
    in the grand scheme of life, but
    I believe I lack any intelligence outside of school.
    I believe common sense
    is less and less common nowadays.
    I believe that the true intelligence we humans have
    is diminishing as a whole.
    I believe our entire technology infrastructure
    is a time bomb waiting to collapse.
    I believe a global catastrophe would not fare well, but
    I believe solving problems are
    the only way for us to improve and expand.
    I believe learning is a matter of attitude.
    I believe work is only work if you don’t enjoy it.
    I believe passion is the only true motivator,
    the only one to pull you by the cuff
    and yell at you to get working, but in a way
    that you somehow enjoy.
    I believe creativity is fostered
    not by force, but by passion and want.
    I believe math is easier than science,
    science more interesting than Spanish,
    spanish slower than American government,
    American government less creative than English.
    I believe Dylan is telling me to stop writing now because
    I believe this assignment was only supposed to be a page.
    I believe long poems would be
    more meaningful had they been written in prose, but
    I believe that repetition and parallelism
    add purpose to a poem.
    I believe pattern recognition separates us
    from other non-sentient beings.
    I believe trees cannot feel, but
    I believe cutting trees past our demand
    is a war against nature that will
    only result in the loss of one or both of us.
    I believe time is the only constant.
    I believe time speeds up when you’re having fun,
    but it doesn’t slow down when you’re not.
    I believe test taking is quite the challenge,
    but only so because of time.
    I believe it’s only a matter of time
    before China and India surpass our economy,
    their people not taking everything for granted.
    I believe gratefulness and thankfulness is sometimes
    the only thing that roots us in reality.
    I believe many of us don’t understand the true
    comforts we live in today.
    I believe today is a time of opportunity, of
    competition and attitude.
    I believe my life is all built upon a trampoline,
    a safety net of people who care
    to guide and save me.
    I believe many people do not feel
    the same way as I do, and I feel sorry for them.
    I believe I’m getting bored of this poem.
    I believe I have not reached my eight-page goal, but
    I believe that I’m done writing this poem now.
