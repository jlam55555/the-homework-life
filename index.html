					<h1 id="aboutTitle">About <em>The Homework Life</em> blog.</h1>
					<p>Hello, World! This is an experimental blog by Jonathan Lam. Why does he blog? He likes to share my view of the world. He likes to complain to deaf ears. He's somewhat odd in my obsessions. He's embraces his nerdy self. He's a bit narcissistic. He wants to improve his English. In short, He's a sightly-strange high-schooler who wants to write to express his thoughts and improve his personality. Not necessarily to become more normal, but to embrace his individuality.</p>
					<p>So he wrote this little blog (yes, from scratch). It's a fun ongoing project that he maintains and posts to in order to keep his sanity and talk to the world. To give himself a false-impression of audience. To work on presentability and professionality. To keep a growing record that can be looked back on and criticized in order to better himself in the future. Naturally, this blog will focus on himself.</p>
					<p>However, Jon is open to contributions from fellow high-schoolers (or somewhere in that range) who feel the same way. Similarly, constructive criticism would be appreciated. His email is <a class="dark" href="mailto:jlam55555@gmail.com?subject=Blog%20Feedback">jlam55555@gmail.com</a>.</p>
					<p>Happy reading! Jon, who has been so self-conscious in this introduction, will proceed to talk in the first person in the blog posts in order to be more open and personal.</p>
