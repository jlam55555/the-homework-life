The code for my website and blog, "The Homework Life"
![The Homework Life logo](http://s8.postimg.org/q71d6k36d/thehomeworklife.png)

#### Description
It's a blog. It's a website. It's for coding. It's for school. It's for fun.It's got pictures. It's got modern web design. It's MINE.

#### Omitted Files
For my own safety, as you can see in the `.gitignore`, the following files are omitted:
- `dbData.txt`
- `userData.txt`

Also omitted, because they are in [various other GitHub repositories](https://github.com/jlam55555?tab=repositories), are the projects under `extras/`.
